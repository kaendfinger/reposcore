Repo Score
=========

A webapp for calculating the score for a Github repository.

The strength of a Github repository can be calculated from several different factors, 
including how recently the repository has been updated, how many people contribute to the repository, 
and how many issues and forks have been created. Repo Score measures how well a repository scores in each
